            As a first validation we check if the coordinates of those units actually lie within
            the specified districts and municipalities. Therefore we run a spatial join of unit
            coordinates with the given district boundaries taken from the [Federal Agency for
            Cartography and Geodesy](https://gdz.bkg.bund.de/index.php/default/digitale-geodaten/verwaltungsgebiete.html). 
            To make sure that no mismatching units appear
            due to a low resolution of the boundaries, we introduce a buffer zone of several
            100 meters at each boundary. Units that lie within this buffer zone are
            not counted as mismatch as long as they belong to one of the neighboring districts.
            We separate the results by showing all units, units that were already approved by the DSO,
            and units that are marked as active.
