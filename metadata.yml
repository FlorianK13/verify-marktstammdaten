            # Location errors
            For units with a power larger 30 kW, exact coordinates as well as an address is given. 
            We checked if the coordinates lie in the given districts and municipalities, 
            where the geoboundaries were taken from the [Federal Agency for
            Cartography and Geodesy](https://gdz.bkg.bund.de/index.php/default/digitale-geodaten/verwaltungsgebiete.html). 
            Since geoboundaries do not have an infinite resolution, we added a buffer zone of 
            1.5km to each boundary, so that units that lie on the boundary 
            (or a maximum of 1.5km outside the district / municipality) still pass the test.

        note-system-size:
          library: markdown
          display: |-
            # System Size errors
            The power of an electricity producing unit correlates with its system size. 
            Hence we validated the rated power by comparing it with other quantities that represent 
            system size. For storages and PV systems, the net power should be close to both the power 
            of the inverter and of the modules. The power of PV systems should also correlate with the 
            number of modules and, for ground-mounted PV systems, with the utilized area.

        note-technology-specific:
          library: markdown
          display: |-
            # Technology specific errors
            Some tests are specific for each technology and rely on domain specific knowledge. 
            For each technology, we defined a range of years as accepted installation years. 
            We chose 2030 as a maximum accepted year for planned installations. For wind, solar, 
            and batteries we chose 1980 as earliest years. Since biomass (with solid biomass fuel), 
            combustion, and hydro power plants are older technologies, we allowed earlier installation years. 
            For wind turbines, we also checked that the hub height is larger than the rotor radius, and for PV 
            systems we checked that balcony PV systems have a rated power P < 1kW.
